# Docker-Maven

These images are essentially the same as the ones available on the [public docker registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven) but extended with some graphical libraries necessary for some UI-related builds.

The images are available via the Github container registry. See the correpsonding [package](https://github.com/orgs/MDSD-Tools/packages/container/package/maven) for details on available versions.
